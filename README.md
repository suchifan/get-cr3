# get-cr3

A small change to the kernel module in guest VM which prints out the cr3 of the test program. 

The new hello.c in the attachment search process by name, so you do not need to change pid value every time you run the test program. Only one requirement, you test program should run under name 'chao_test' as specified in the hello.c, you can change it to whatever you want.
